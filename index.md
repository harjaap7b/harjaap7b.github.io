## Projects

### Proejct 1: [Stellar Classification](https://github.com/harjaap7b/Stars)
In this project I used random forests and neural network algorithims to classify stars. In astronomy classification of astronomical objects is a big subject since there are so many types of objects that can be observed in the night sky. The classification is based soley on their spectral charactersitics, like their redshift. Although there are many more features which come into play which I will dicuss in the project.

### Project 2: [Classifying Heart Disease](https://github.com/harjaap7b/Classifying-Heart-Disease.git)
In this project I used the database from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation that extracts data from various patients, such as thier sex, age, BMI etc. to look at if they have heart disease or not. For this I project I used the classic logistic regression classification machine learning algorithim. I also added some PCA analysis at the end to futher deep dive into the data to figure out which features give out the best predictions.

### Project 3: [Predicting Employee Productivity using Tree Models](https://github.com/harjaap7b/Classification-Tree)
In this project I aimed to make use of decision trees and random forests to predict employee productivity in the garment industry. The garment industry is one the largest industries in the 21st century. It is also a highly labour intensive industry, therefore statisfying the huge demand is mostly dependant on the employee productivity and performance. It is highly desirable among decision makers to track and predict the productivity performance of their employees. This project will aim to do just that using the help of random forest and decision tree ML algorithims.

### Project 4: [Northwind traders Project SQL](https://github.com/harjaap7b/Northwind-Traders)
In this project I analyzed northwind traders which is an international gourmet food distributor. I looked at the Northwind database to do the following: evaluate employee performance to boost productivity, optimzing inventory and marketing strategies by analyzing product sales, looking at the sales growth to see any trends and make forecasts based on the company progress, see client behavior to single out high value clients and offer promotions, and all of this was done with the help of SQL and Python.

### Project 5: [Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/harjaap7b/CreditCard-KMeans)
In this project I imagined that I was working for a credit card company as data scientist with the task of analyzing customer data to segement the population. The dataset contains information about the company's clients which I will use to segment the client population into different types in order to give the marketing team a more targeted approach. It has been decided that I will use the K-Means model to segment the data.

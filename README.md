### Project 1: [Classifying Heart Disease](https://github.com/harjaap7b/Classifying-Heart-Disease.git)
In this project I will be using the database from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation that uses data from various patients, such as thier sex, age, BMI etc. to look at if they have heart disease or not. For this we will be using the classic logistic regression classification machine learning algorithim. I also added some PCA analysis at the end to futher deep dive into the data to figure out which features give out the best predictions.
